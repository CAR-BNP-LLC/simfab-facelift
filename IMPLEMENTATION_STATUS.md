## 📋 **Optional: Initial Data Seeding**

**Status**: ⚠️ Intentionally Left as Placeholder

- [x] Migration file exists (`037_seed_page_products.sql`)
- [ ] Contains only placeholders/comments (intentional)
- **Reason**: Product IDs are database-specific and must be configured via admin UI

**This is expected!** The seed migration is a template. Actual products should be configured via the admin dashboard after:
1. Products exist in the database
2. Admin identifies which products go where
3. Products are added via the intuitive admin interface

---

## 🚀 **What You Need to Do Next**

### 1. Run Database Migration (If Not Done)
```bash
cd server
npm run migrate:up
```

### 2. Configure Products via Admin Dashboard
1. Log in to `/admin`
2. Go to "Page Products" tab
3. For each page section:
   - Click "Edit"
   - Click "Add Product"
   - Search and select products
   - Drag to reorder
   - Toggle active/inactive
   - Click "Save Changes"

### 3. Test Frontend Pages
- Visit `/sim-racing` - should show products
- Visit `/flight-sim` - should show products
- Visit `/monitor-stands` - should show products
- Visit homepage - sections should show products
