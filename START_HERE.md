To test dynamic pricing, you need to add variations. Here's the easiest way:

### Quick SQL Method

```sql
psql simfab_dev

-- Get your product ID
SELECT id, name FROM products;

-- Add a variation (replace product_id with your ID)
INSERT INTO product_variations (product_id, variation_type, name, is_required)
VALUES (1, 'dropdown', 'Rudder Pedals', true)
RETURNING id;

-- Add options (replace variation_id with ID from above)
INSERT INTO variation_options (variation_id, option_name, option_value, price_adjustment, is_default)
VALUES 
(1, 'Standard', 'standard', 0, true),
(1, 'Premium', 'premium', 150, false),
(1, 'Custom', 'custom', 300, false);

\q
```

**Now go to product detail page:**
- You'll see "Rudder Pedals" dropdown
- Select "Premium" → Price updates to $1,149! 🎉
- Select "Custom" → Price updates to $1,299! 🎉
