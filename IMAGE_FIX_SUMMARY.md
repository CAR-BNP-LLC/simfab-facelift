# Image Display Fix Summary

## Problem
Product images were not displaying on the product detail pages or in the admin dashboard, even though the images were uploaded and stored in the database.

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Frontend/Backend Field Name Mismatch
- **Backend** returns: `image_url`, `alt_text`, `is_primary`
- **Frontend** expected: `url`, `alt`, `isPrimary`

### Issue 2: Product API Not Fetching Images
- The `getProductBySlug` endpoint in `productController.ts` was using a simplified query that didn't fetch images from the `product_images` table
- It was not using the proper `ProductService.getProductBySlug()` method

### Issue 3: Missing Admin Endpoint
- Admin dashboard was calling `GET /api/admin/products/:id/images` to fetch product images
- This endpoint did not exist (only POST, PUT, DELETE existed)

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated API Types (`src/services/api.ts`)
```typescript
export interface ProductImage {
  id: number;
  image_url: string;        // was: url
  alt_text: string | null;  // was: alt
  is_primary: boolean;      // was: isPrimary
  sort_order: number;       // added
  product_id: number;       // added
  created_at: string;       // added
}
```

#### 2. Updated Image References
Updated all files to check `image_url` first, then fall back to `url`:
- `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx`
- `src/pages/Shop.tsx`
- `src/components/Header.tsx`
- `src/pages/Cart.tsx`
- `src/pages/OrderConfirmation.tsx`
- `src/pages/Checkout.tsx`
- `src/components/CartSidebar.tsx`

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Fixed Product Controller (`server/src/controllers/productController.ts`)
**Before:**
```typescript
getProductBySlug = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  // ... simplified query without images
  const sql = 'SELECT * FROM products WHERE slug = $1';
  // ... manual data fetching without images
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
getProductBySlug = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    const slug = req.params.slug;
    const product = await this.productService.getProductBySlug(slug);
    res.json(successResponse(product, 'Product retrieved successfully'));
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
```

#### 2. Added Admin Images Endpoint

**Controller Method** (`server/src/controllers/adminProductController.ts`):
```typescript
getImages = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    const productId = parseInt(req.params.id);
    const images = await this.imageService.getImagesByProduct(productId);
    res.json(successResponse(images, 'Images retrieved successfully'));
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
```

**Route** (`server/src/routes/admin/products.ts`):
```typescript
router.get(
  '/:id/images',
  controller.getImages
);
```

## How to Apply

1. **Restart Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Restart Frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Image Ordering

All product images are now sorted to show the **primary/featured image first**:
1. Images marked as `is_primary = true` appear first
2. Remaining images are sorted by `sort_order`

This ensures the featured image is always displayed first in:
- Product detail page gallery
- Product cards in shop/catalog
- Featured products in mega menu

## Expected Result

After restarting both servers:
- ✅ Product detail pages will display all product images with primary image first
- ✅ Admin dashboard will show product images in the product list
- ✅ Admin product editor will display the image gallery
- ✅ Featured products in mega menu will show the primary image
- ✅ Product cards in shop will show the primary image

## Technical Notes

- The `ProductService.getProductBySlug()` method properly joins with the `product_images` table and returns images as a JSON array
- The `ProductQueryBuilder` includes images in the SELECT query for product listings
- All image URLs should be in the format: `http://localhost:3001/uploads/filename.png`
- Images are stored in the `server/uploads/` directory
