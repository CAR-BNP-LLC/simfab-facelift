10+  years
We chose PU fabric because it’s far superior to the commonly used PU artificial leather. PU leatherette material lasts up to two years on average before it starts disintegrating but PU fabric lasts 10+ years. It is also more breathable than PU leather, which tends to sweat.

Maximum comfort 
SimFab full-size racing seats are made of steel tubular inner frame and thick cold-cured foam, providing maximum comfort for long hours of gaming. The cockpit can be converted for general lounging or console gaming use.

The seat is offered in six vibrant colors of choices: black, red, blue, orange, green and yellow.

Includes assorted mounting hardware for straightforward installation.

Installation notes & compatibility

Clamp?on shakers (example: ButtKicker Gamer2 or Advance) clamp directly to the bracket?s vertical arm. Do not over?tighten the shaker?s factory clamping bolt?tighten only to the shaker manufacturer?s recommended snugness to avoid damage.
Bolted shakers: secure using two bolts placed diagonally through the bracket slots.
Mounting position affects feel: mounting the shaker farther from the frame increases overall vibration translation into the cockpit; mounting closer produces a tighter, more localized response. Adjust position to tune feedback to your preference.
If all available frame slots are already occupied, an optional?4?way coupling?is required for additional mounting points.

What?s included

Universal shaker bracket (mild steel, zinc plated, sand?blasted)
Assorted mounting hardware (bolts, washers, nuts, spacers)
Instructions for clamp-on and bolted installations

Safety & care

Do not overtighten factory clamping bolts or fasteners?this may damage the shaker or bracket.
Regularly check hardware for tightness and corrosion. The zinc plating provides protection, but periodic inspection is recommended in high?humidity environments.

Compatible brands shakers and low frequency transducers:

Cutting-edge full-size flight simulator seat

Our flight sim seats are specially designed and equipped with a variety of features to enhance and provide a realistic and immersive flying experience. They are crafted to replicate the cockpit of an aircraft and are used by professional pilots, flight training centers, and flight simulation enthusiasts. Our seats are a key component in creating an authentic and engaging flight simulation experience.
When not using the center stick, the removable foam insert is secured back in place by an industrial-strength oversized hook and loop patch, returning the seat base to its default setting.

Reclining Mechanism



Immerse yourself in the virtual skies with a seamlessly adjustable reclining mechanism. Achieve the perfect angle to suit your flight simulation needs.



Sliders



Tailor your seat's position to your exact specifications with precision sliders, ensuring a snug and personalized fit.

Functional Seat Base Cutout



Our innovative seat design includes a strategically engineered cutout, providing the freedom for full stick motion with grip extension or cyclic, without any intrusion into the seat foam. Maintain a natural, ergonomic reach for uninterrupted flight precision.



Removable Foam Insert



Easily customize your seat's cushioning with a removable foam insert. Experience unparalleled support and comfort, personalized to your liking.

PU fabric lasts 10+ years



We chose PU fabric because it’s far superior to the commonly used PU artificial leather. PU leatherette material lasts up to two years on average before it starts disintegrating but PU fabric lasts 10+ years. It is also more breathable than PU leather, which tends to sweat.

Maximum comfort



SimFab full-size racing seats are made of steel tubular inner frame, thick cold-cured foam and breathable fabric upholstery, providing maximum comfort for long hours of gaming.

The seat is offered in six vibrant colors of choices: black, red, blue, orange, green and yellow.

At SimFab, we prioritize quality, functionality, and comfort above all else.

DD conversion kit with included pedal plate assembly is suitable for owners of Gen2 chassis where older design pedal plate assembly is not compatible with Gen3, as well as converting to DD chassis.

DD Conversion Kit Plus is also suitable for users with flight sim cockpit looking to convert to sim racing with more demanding heavier direct drive wheels.

Generally it is recommended to use cross bar wheel mount for direct drive wheels with 12+ NM force feedback as opposed to Gen3 chassis with wheel single post design. Tradeoff with cross bar vs single post is a bit longer downtime during swapping out between sim racing and flight sim.

Left and right horizontal consoles fit up to 4 controls on each side of cockpit seat.

Optional extended upper L bracket is required when pair of controls are used beside each other. Each control slot has assigned its unique reference number as illustrated in “SimFab bare-bones schematic”.

There are total of four universal adapter plates compatible for horizontal mount. Each universal plate has assigned its unique reference number as illustrated in “SimFab Universal Adapter Plates” compatibility schematics. Each plate is predrilled to accept various group of controls as illustrated and listed.

Purchasing optional extended upper L bracket assumes an already existing SimFab cockpit with one adapter plate on either side, part of default base package.

Elevate Your Sim Experience



At SimFab, we are dedicated to not only enhancing your immersion but also ensuring your comfort during extended simming sessions. Our patented design features a seat with a slanted, fully functional seat base cutout, allowing for motion-free use of your fighter stick, even with grip extensions.

This setup places your controls at the perfect arm’s reach, whether you’re using a standard grip or an extended stick as a helicopter cyclic.

The seat is generously padded with foam to guarantee the comfort you desire for those long missions.

Versatile Adaptability



While our DCS cockpit excels in the realm of DCS World simulation, it is not limited to it. Optional add-on plates and brackets are available to convert your setup into a civil/commercial aviation cockpit or a space sim ship.

For those who seek even greater versatility in the simulation world, we offer the option to easily convert it into a sim racing cockpit, with dedicated conversion kits readily available.
