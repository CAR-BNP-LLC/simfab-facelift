## üìù Best Practices

1. **Product Ordering**: Order products by priority/importance
   - Most important products first
   - Featured products at top
   - Sale items prominently placed

2. **Active/Inactive Management**:
   - Use inactive state instead of deleting
   - Easier to reactivate later
   - Maintains order history

3. **Homepage Sections**:
   - Keep products limited (2-4 max)
   - Focus on best sellers or featured items
   - Update seasonally for promotions

4. **Category Mode**:
   - Use for sections that should auto-update
   - Set appropriate `maxItems` limit
   - Ensure category naming is consistent

## üîÑ Migration from Hardcoded Data

If you had hardcoded products before, you can manually recreate them:

1. For each hardcoded product array, identify the actual products in your catalog
2. Use admin dashboard to add them to appropriate sections
3. Set display order to match original order
4. Test frontend pages to verify display
