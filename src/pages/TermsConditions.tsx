            <p className="text-foreground mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              (a) YOU AND THE MANUFACTURER ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. If not resolved through negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, whether pre-existing, present, or future, and including statutory, consumer protection, common law, intentional tort, injunctive and equitable claims) between you and the Manufacturer arising from or relating in any way to your purchase of the products will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              (b) The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its then-current commercial arbitration rules and procedures. The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              (c) The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or these Terms are void, voidable, or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              (d) You may elect to pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration if you provide the Manufacturer with written notice of your intention to do so within sixty (60) days of delivery of the products. The arbitration or small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy.
