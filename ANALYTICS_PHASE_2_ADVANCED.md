    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_spent
  FROM orders
  WHERE payment_status = 'paid'
    AND created_at >= $1
  GROUP BY user_id

  const revenueVelocity = product.totalRevenue / product.daysActive;
  const stockTurnover = product.totalSold / product.averageStock;
  const profitMargin = product.profitMargin;

  // Weighted score (0-100)
  return (
    salesVelocity * 0.3 +
    revenueVelocity * 0.3 +
    stockTurnover * 0.2 +
    profitMargin * 0.2
  ) * 10; // Scale to 0-100
};
```

**New API Endpoints**:
```typescript
GET /api/admin/analytics/products/performance?period=30d&limit=20
GET /api/admin/analytics/products/categories?period=30d

**Requirements**:
- Auto-refresh functionality (30s, 1m, 5m intervals)
- Real-time notifications for critical metrics
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Background sync when tab becomes active

**Implementation Strategy**:
```tsx
// src/hooks/useRealTimeAnalytics.ts
export const useRealTimeAnalytics = (enabled: boolean = true) => {
  const [lastUpdate, setLastUpdate] = useState<Date>(new Date());
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!enabled) return;

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      // Fetch latest analytics data
      refetchAnalytics();
      setLastUpdate(new Date());
    }, 30000); // 30 second updates

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [enabled]);

  // WebSocket connection for critical updates
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.REACT_APP_WS_URL);
    // WebSocket event handlers
  }, []);

  return { lastUpdate, isOnline };
};
```
